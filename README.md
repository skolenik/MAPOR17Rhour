# MAPOR17Rhour

Materials for the MAPOR 2017 R Coding Hour

## Directories and files

This directory includes the markdown and rendered HTML files of the three chapters of the presentation, and the setup code ([MAPOR17-coding-hour-00-setup.R](MAPOR17-coding-hour-00-setup.R)). Please run this setup script so that you have the libraries that you need for the MAPOR 2017 R coding hour.

The [Datasets](Datasets) folder contains the data sets used in the presentation.

The [Datasets/Pew](Datasets/Pew) folder contains the worked out example of R Markdown as used with Pew Research Center data sets.

## Before the class starts

1. Have an up-to-date version of R on your computer (go to https://cran.r-project.org/ for the current version information and download instructions; in `R`,  type `R.version` to find out what your version is)
2. Clone/download the repository: `clone` requires that you be a GitHub user; otherwise, you can `download` a zip file with everything.
3. Run `MAPOR17-coding-hour-00-setup.R` script to `install.packages()` that we will be using.
4. (extra credit) Download [R Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf).
